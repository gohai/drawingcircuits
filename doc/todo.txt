Still to slow
Implement object rotation for patterns
Bug: Pattern rotation on bottom layer
Bug: Jumper drawing
Bug: Part drills vs outline zoomed?
Look through all TODOs in source tree

-- 0.2
Re-implement selection (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+D, Tab, Shift & click)
Implement highlight
Implements parts UI: Add drawing > name, file, [upload]; Add variant > name, parent, pins (with title, mark, description), title, description, longDescription, datasheet, datasheetPage, [commit]; Add comment > part, comment, [commit]; Add supplier > part, supplier, partNumber, url, [commit]; provide feedback whether contribution it is visible or not
Fix drawing behind the UI
Implement 404
Rework colors
Fix SVG rendering on Firefox
Implement annotations toggle (also show pin names)
Implement users (localStorage, .input-block-level, .btn, salt the hash)
Implement metadata: title, description, bom, isPattern
Implement gallery (filter for patterns, rating & use count)
Implement schematics library
Re-implement recording of traces (using Web Sockets)
Set window title in .load
Switch URLs to "//.." (also in Hotglue)
Add project description to page ("?" in top right corner)

-- later
Trace outline with paper.js (var svgNode = paper.project.exportSvg(); var svg = new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(svgNode); see also: http://potrace.sourceforge.net/)
Implement Don Mode (background images, music, random schematics and parts to use)
Milling: multiple passes for drills and substrate, slower in z axis
Milling: explore explore error, xz, yz, xy parameters in png_path
Milling: try a different software that uses scan line patterns
Milling: multiple passes with different end mills
Milling: ensure a clean edge (see direction parameter in path_rml)
Milling: option to cut a rectangle around board
Milling: approximate runtime
Support Pads
Tablet compatibility
Mailing list, including new submissions waiting to be moderated
checkMillability (traces being too narrow, drill hole diameters - including parts)
GND & VCC annotations
Segmentation & show connections
Smooth drawing using paper.js
Try bmp2cnc (0.22)
Export: Per-device quirks, PDF for etching, PDF for stencil, PDF for solder mask, PDF with build instructions
Revisit variable names (emphasize units), mark static functions, document functions
Make the canvas size static, introduce own viewport
Try ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled
Try a steady redraw
Try 1 bit per pixel
Make it possible to flip layers when applying a pattern
